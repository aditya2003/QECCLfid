# QECCLfid


This package contains modules to simulate quantum error correction under correlated Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) maps. It uses tensor network approaches to construct instances of these maps. Although, best used in conjunction with [chflow](https://github.com/paviudes/chflow), it serves as a standalone package too.
